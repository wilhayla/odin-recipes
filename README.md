# odin-recipes
# This is my first web project. I am going to build a basic recipe website.
# In this project I am going to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired on theodinproject.com.
# In this project I am going to practice to create an HTML file, add the first structure of an HTML code like DOCTYPE,
# defining an HTML block element and body, create a head with meta element, create titles, paragraphs, headings, format text,
# adding comments, create lists, links, add images and create new pages.
