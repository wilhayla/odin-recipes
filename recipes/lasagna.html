    <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
        For this recipe, we are essencially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce<br>
        and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the<br>
        run-down:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and<br>
                a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The<br>
                hree kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.<br>
                We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan—like<br>
                the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great<br>
                flavor!
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of<br>
                Wnoodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you<br>
                have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
